# strider-wireframe
UI Experiment for a potential upcoming project

## Update: Oct. 17, 2017
The above was made a year ago. At the time, I was unfamiliar with how to push my repository to GitHub. I'm adding my wireframe I made as a class project and to give Innovation Island business advisor, Graham Truax, an idea of what I was thinking. If you go to https://stridr.social you'll see a lot of similarities.

It's quite something to look back on this. I feel like I have learned more this year than I have in the previous 10. College gave me a taste of knowledge, and I think this may only be the beginning.
